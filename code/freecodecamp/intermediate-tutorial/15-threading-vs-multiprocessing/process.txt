Process: An instance of a program (e.g a Pthon intrepeter) 

+ Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
+ Separate memory space -> Memory is not shared between proceesses
+ Great for CPU-bound processing 
+ New process is started indepently from other processes 
+ One GIL for each process -> avoids GIL limitation 

- Heavyweight 
- starting a process is slower than starting a thread. 
- More memory 
- IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated
