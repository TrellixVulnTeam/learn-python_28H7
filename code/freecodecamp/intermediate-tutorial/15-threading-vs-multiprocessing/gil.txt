GIL: Global interpreter lock 
- A lock that allows only one thread at a time to execute in Python 

- Needed in (Python because memory management is not thread-safe) 

- Avoid: 
	- Use multiprocessing 
	- Use a different, free-threaded Python implementation (Jython, IronPython) 
	- Use a python as a wrapper for third-party libararies (C/C++) -> numpy, scipy
